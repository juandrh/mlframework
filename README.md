# Regression Machine learning framework
Based on [Abhishek Thakur ML Framework](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/mlframework) and all the help provided by him, [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook), [Luca Massaron](https://www.kaggle.com/lucamassaron) and a lot of kagglers. Thank you very much.

This framework has been implemeted during ['30 Days of ML' Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/30-days-of-ml) to help in future regression proyects. As a beginner in Machine Learning and Python programming, I'm sure there is a lot of room for improving it (for example: add stacking, switch code to classes), feel free to copy and modify. 

This framework can be used executing de run.sh file in terminal (sh run.sh). In this file set the global variables and uncomment the piece of code you want to run.
